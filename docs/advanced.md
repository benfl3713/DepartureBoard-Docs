### Auto Accept Cookies

If you are trying to show the website on a custom signage board, or embedded frame, then you may find the cookies banner keeps popping up. To get rid of this you can add the extra **acceptCookies** parameter to the url.

E.g
[www.leddepartureboard.com/EUS?acceptCookies=true](https://www.leddepartureboard.com/EUS?acceptCookies=true)

Or if you already are using a parameter then use **&** instead
[www.leddepartureboard.com/EUS?platform=1&acceptCookies=true](https://www.leddepartureboard.com/EUS?platform=1&acceptCookies=true)
