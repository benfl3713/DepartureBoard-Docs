import BrowserWindow from "@site/src/components/BrowserWindow";

The main board is the default type, and shows multiple departures, and all the stops along the journey, on rectangular panels.

## Viewing

You can use the search box to find the station you want or put the station CRS code into the browser url.
E.g The CRS code for **London Euston** is `EUS`. So therefor the view departure for Euston you would go to <https://leddepartureboard.com/EUS>
This will then show you, by default, the next 6 departures from Euston.

<BrowserWindow url="https://leddepartureboard.com/EUS" backgroundColor="black">
