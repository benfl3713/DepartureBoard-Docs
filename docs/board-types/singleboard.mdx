import BrowserWindow from "@site/src/components/BrowserWindow";

The single board shows the next 3 departures from a station, and all the stops along the journey, on a scrolling line, for the first departure.

## Viewing

You can use the search box to find the station you want and tick the singleboard option, or put the station CRS code into the browser url.
E.g The CRS code for **London Euston** is `EUS`. So therefor to view the departure for Euston you would go to <https://leddepartureboard.com/singleboard/EUS>

<BrowserWindow

  backgroundColor="black"

</BrowserWindow>

## Configuration

There are many different config options that change the way the single board functions

### Platform

The platform can be set to only show departures from a specific platform.  
To do so just add the platform parameter to the url. E.g <https://leddepartureboard.com/singleboard/EUS?platform=9>

### Station Name

By Default the Station Name is not shown when viewing a station. There is also 2 ways to show the station name.

1. You can go to [Settings](https://leddepartureboard.com/settings) and click on **Single Board**. And then toggle **Show Station Name**.
2. You can add the url parameter to the end of the url.  
   E.g <https://leddepartureboard.com/singleboard/EUS?showStationName=true> or if there is already a parameter then use the `&` symbol instead. E.g <https://leddepartureboard.com/singleboard/EUS?platform=9&showStationName=true>

<!-- ## Clickable Items

Various parts on each departure can be clicked to change something. -->
