Led Departure Board has lots of hidden features to make your life easier or to do advance features. Here is a list of some of the best ones.

---

1. When on the departure board page if you click on any of the destinations
    or stops along the way, it will change the board to that station.
2. If you click the platform number on any of the board, then it will filter the board to only show departures from that    platform.
3. If you click the clock it will take you back to the home page
4. If you want to add multiple query parameters to the url use the **&** imbetween each one. e.g [www.leddepartureboard.com/EUS?hideClock=true&platform=5](https://www.leddepartureboard.com/EUS?hideClock=true&platform=5)
